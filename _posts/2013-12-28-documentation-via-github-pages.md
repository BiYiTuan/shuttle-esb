title: Moved documentation over to GitHub Pages
layout: post

I decided to go with GitHub Pages for our documentation.  Getting Jekyll working locally on Windows 8 was somewhat tricky but I have ended upwith a structure that I am happy with.

The API-orentied pages render using Flatdoc and the syntax highlighter I selected after quite a bit of evaluation was HighlightJS.

If you pick up any issues with the dccumentation please log it.  You are also welcome to fork the [Shuttle repository[(https://github.com/Shuttle/shuttle-esb) and update the documentation before sending a pull request.
